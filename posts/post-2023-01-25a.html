                            <h1>Book Review</h1>
							<span class="first-child-span">Dutch Words and Phrases for Creative & Visual Learners of All Ages (Color and Learn)</span>
							<p class="first-child">Recently, I received a couple “adult" coloring books as a gift. While shopping for a set of colored pencils, I browsed for other coloring books but didn't find anything else I'd be interested in. While browsing for books and such to learn Dutch, however, I found this and was intrigued, to say the least, by several parts of the phrase “for Creative & Visual Learners of All Ages". My Dutch partner said it was “an interesting take on learning a new language".</p>
                            
                            <h2>Part One: Unboxing</h2>
                                <p>First of all, thank you, Amazon, for including a live updating map for your drivers so watching my packages get delivered causes as much excitement and anxiety as waiting for my UberEats delivery. Oh, and for perforating your envelopes.</p>
                                <p>First impression upon removing it was how heavy it is -- I didn't pay attention to how many pages it was in the description -- I bought it solely based on the title. The cover is very well designed -- even more impressive in real life.</p>
                                <p>While looking at it, I forgot for a moment that it was for learning another language and wondered why milk was misspelled. Reminds me of the time I was walking around Mexicantown in Detroit where (I thought) 100% of the signs were in Spanish. One day I stopped, confused, trying to figure out what a certain word was, sounding it out phonetically in my head until I realized it was English.</p>
                                <p>First attribute to inspect would be the quality of images. Buyers of coloring books beware that many of them are images people download, enlarge and publish despite how pixelated and awful they are, knowing people like me will buy them based on the beautiful color and what they imagine the content will look like beyond the preview.</p>
                                <p>A cursory scan and random flipping perusal impressed me. The images, crisp and beautiful, are mixed with what appears to be a truly great 190 pages of quality instruction including quizzes with content covering grammar and pronunciation. Wow. I'm pleasantly surprised.</p>
                                <p>As the Amazon product description states, “This book will transform Dutch learning for good -- no more complex textbooks, it's time to learn while having fun!"</p>
                                <p>Gimme a couple days to color and I'll report what I've learned (and how).
                                </p>
